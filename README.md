## About SACSIM19

SACOG, as the designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Sacramento region, has the primary responsibility for the development and maintenance of its travel demand forecasting methods and models. These models are used by agencies like SACOG for regional-scale policy analyses of land use and transportation plans, as well as for analyses of the effects of exogenous variables, like fuel prices and demographic change (e.g. aging of the population). The travel demand model currently used by SACOG is the Sacramento Activity-Based Travel Simulation Model, or “SACSIM”. SACSIM19 is the version of SACSIM used for the 2020 Metropolitan Transportation Plan-Sustainable Communities Strategy (MTP-SCS).

This SACSIM19 repository contains scripts used to prepare and run the SACSIM travel, along with supplementary scripts for additional model-based analyses.

## In This Repository
The SACSIM19 GitHub repository primarily contains scripts needed to run the travel model. However, running SACSIM requires, in addition to these scripts, a significant number of input files, along with required software packages specified in the [model documentation](https://www.sacog.org/travel-model-documentation).

### Accessing MTP-SCS Scenario Runs
The scripts in this repository are not intended to be specific to any one scenario that SACOG ran as part of its MTP-SCS. Instead, they are the latest versions of the script files we use that we make available to the user community in case they wish to make their own customizations or updates to the script for their particular use case. If you wish to access full model runs for specific MTP-SCS scenarios, please complete a data request form, available through [SACOG's modeling home page](https://www.sacog.org/modeling).

### Accessing Model Input Files
As mentioned above, this repository does not contain the large input files SACSIM requires (e.g. highway network, land parcel files, population files, etc.) To request access to the input files needed, please complete a data request form, available through [SACOG's modeling home page](https://www.sacog.org/modeling).
