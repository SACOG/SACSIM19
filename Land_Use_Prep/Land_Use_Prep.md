# Land Use Input Preparation

*Last Updated: 3/11/2021*

SACSIM land use inputs are the primary data source for households  and jobs on each parcel. While SACSIM does not require land use  input updates to run, users may wish to make their own  adjustments to land use and population to test alternative  scenarios. To aid users in making these adjustments, SACOG staff  have provided multiple processing tools and documentation to help  users assemble SACSIMâ€™s parcel-point land use and population  inputs. Assembly of additional land use inputs such as school  employment and enrollments, street pattern, off-street parking  supply and cost, and transit proximity are also described in the  resources below.

The python scripts here are provided to help with land use process, though you may use SACOG-provided spreadsheets as an alternative for land use input preparation. To request these processing spreadsheets and supplemental resources,  contact [sacsim@sacog.org](mailto:sacsim@sacog.org)  and a link will be provided to our FTP site.
